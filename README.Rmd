<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **steward** is to make it easier to import, manage, and publish the metadata associated with data frames. This might be useful for:

- [documenting a dataset](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data) for a package
- publishing a data-dictionary [table](https://gt.rstudio.com) in an R Markdown document

Our current defintion of metadata includes the name, description and source of a dataset, as well as the name, type, and description of each of the variables in the dataset.

The name, steward, is an homage to the [Data Stewardship](http://agron590-isu.github.io/) class taught by [Andee Kaplan](https://github.com/andeek) and [Ranae Dietzel](https://github.com/ranae) (also an author of this package) at Iowa State University in Fall 2016.

This package was first built collaborativey at the [Uncoast Unconf](https://uuconf.rbind.io), held at Des Moines in April 2019.

## Installation

You can install the development version of steward from [GitHub](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("uncoast-unconf/steward")
```

## Usage

In our [getting started article](https://uncoast-unconf.github.io/steward/articles/steward.html), we describe some common tasks:

- create a "steward" dataset.
- write a dataset to a package, with documentation.
- create a [gt table](https://gt.rstudio.com).

### Future development

We plan to release this package to CRAN as soon as the [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com) package is released there.

Some of the capabilities we plan to develop:

- take into account [timezone as column metadata](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward/issues/39)
- [build metadata from package-documentation](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward/issues/43) (`.Rd` file)

## Related work

The [codebook](https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook) package can help you manage dataset metadata.
