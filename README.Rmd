# steward

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of **steward** is to make it easier to import, manage, and publish the metadata associated with data frames. This might be useful for:

- [documenting a dataset](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#documenting-data) for a package
- publishing a data dictionary in an R Markdown document

Our current defintion of metadata includes the name, description and source of a dataset, as well as the name, type, and description of each of the variables in the dataset.

The name, steward, is an homage to the [Data Stewardship](http://agron590-isu.github.io/) class taught by [Andee Kaplan](https://github.com/andeek) and [Ranae Dietzel](https://github.com/ranae) (also an author of this package) at Iowa State University in Fall 2016.

## Installation

You can install the development version of steward from [GitHub](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("uncoast-unconf/steward")
```

## Usage

```{r load}
library("steward")
```

### Current capabilities

You can read about these capabilities in the [getting started article](https://uncoast-unconf.github.io/steward/articles/steward.html):

- read from YAML
- read from CSV
- write to YAML
- write to roxygen
- write to [gt table](https://gt.rstudio.com)

Here are the first lines of a YAML file containing metadata from [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)'s `diamonds` dataset, which is available as:

```r
system.file("metadata/diamonds.yml", package = "steward")
```

```{r yaml, echo = FALSE, comment = "", output.lines = 11}
system.file("metadata/diamonds.yml", package = "steward") %>%
  readr::read_lines() %>%
  glue::glue_collapse(sep = "\n")
```

You can read this YAML file using `stw_read_yaml()`:

```{r read_yaml}
diamonds_meta <-
  stw_read_yaml(system.file("metadata/diamonds.yml", package = "steward"))

print(diamonds_meta)
```

To get a roxygen string from metadata, you can use the `stw_to_roxygen()` function:

```{r to_roxygen}
cat(stw_to_roxygen(diamonds_meta))
```

You may also be interested in the related functions: `stw_use_roxygen()` and `stw_write_roxygen()`.

### Future capabilities

Soon, we hope to add additional capabilities:

- [combine metadata with dataset](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward/issues/36)
  - [read and write combined dataset](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward/issues/41) from/to flat files
- take into account [timezone as column metadata](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward/issues/39)
- [build metadata from package-documentation](https://github.com/uncoast-unconf/steward/issues/43) (`.Rd` file)
